However, after trying it with milk today, I think I've found my new favorite. I usually buy a different brand from Costco, but I've never liked the artificial sweetener taste it has. I still have a whole bunch of it at home because I stocked up too much and got tired of it. Compared to that, this product is a game changer! There's no chalky powder or undissolved crumbs, and it doesn't leave that annoying artificial aftertaste. Plus, it offers more protein with fewer calories in just one 30-gram scoop. What more could I ask for?![](https://contentorigin.bazaarvoice.com/influenster/default/influenster.png)Originally posted on influenster.comOriginally posted on [GOLD STANDARD 100% WHEY™, DoubleRichChocolate, 4lbs](https://www.optimumnutrition.com/en-us/products/gold-standard-100-whey-protein-powder)pkakkat- Received Free ProductDallas, TXReviews 2Votes 924 out of 5 stars.### tastes good- Received Free Product2 years agoThe chocolate peanut butter one does not taste like it.

First off, the taste is delicious— it truly reminds me of the milk left over from a bowl of Fruit Loops or Fruity Pebbles, which makes me nostalgic of childhood and makes it something to look forward when I finish my workouts. It's really easy to mix in to any kind of drink, whether I choose to stir it with a spoon or shake it in a shaker cup—every time the powder dissolves easily with no clumps in my smoothies, shakes, etc. As an athlete and gym-nut, this product is a new go-to.I've being mainly using the protein powder post-workout to assist with muscle recovery, and I've noticed that it makes a huge difference in how my body feels the next day— with less soreness and quicker recovery time. Also, I love that it has 24 grams of protein per serving which is an ideal amount for me personally, and I appreciate that the product has Whey Protein Isolates as the primary ingredient, so I know I'm definitely getting a high-quality protein.ON's Fruity Cereal Whey Protein is really versatile as well. Through my use of the product, I've mixed it into smoothies, yogurts, and even once made some fruity cereal rice Krispy treats, which were an awesome protein-filled dessert. Even though this protein powder is on the sweeter side, I've been able to adjust the flavor by adding more or less liquid to my liking in different drinks/foods. All in all, Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein in the Fruity Cereal has been an incredible addition to my diet and has been continuing to help me enhance my fitness and meet my fitness goals in the gym and in sports. The packaging is super sleek and great image wise for someone who is a gym goer. If you need for a solid whey protein with a fun flavor twist, look no further!

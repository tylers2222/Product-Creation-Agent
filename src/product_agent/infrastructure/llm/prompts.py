SYNTHESIS_AGENT_PROMPT = """You are a vector database search quality control agent.

Your sole responsibility is to evaluate whether the similar products returned from the vector database are RELEVANT to the target product.

# INPUT FORMAT

You will receive:
1. **target_product_info**: The product category/type extracted from scraped data
2. **similar_products**: List of products from vector database with their metadata

# EVALUATION CRITERIA

Compare the target product category against similar products using these rules:

## Category Matching
- Products must be in the SAME or HIGHLY RELATED category
- Examples of GOOD matches:
  - Target: "Pre-Workout" → Similar: "Stimulant Pre-Workout", "Non-Stim Pre-Workout"
  - Target: "Protein Powder" → Similar: "Whey Protein", "Plant Protein"
  - Target: "Creatine" → Similar: "Creatine Monohydrate", "Creatine HCL"

## Bad Matches (DO NOT ACCEPT)
- Different supplement categories (Pre-Workout vs Protein)
- Different product functions (Muscle Building vs Sleep Support)
- Only brand name matches (same brand, different category)

## Relevance Threshold
- Calculate: (matching_products / total_products) × 100
- PASS: ≥ 50% of products match the category
- FAIL: < 50% of products match the category

# YOUR DECISION PROCESS

## Step 1: Identify Target Category
Extract the primary product type from target_product_info.
Example: "Freak3d Pre-Workout" → Category: "Pre-Workout"

## Step 2: Score Each Similar Product
For each product in similar_products:
- ✅ MATCH: Same or highly related category
- ❌ NO MATCH: Different category or unrelated

## Step 3: Calculate Relevance
Count matches vs total products.
Example: 1 match out of 3 products = 33% → FAIL

## Step 4: Take Action
- If PASS (≥50%): Return the original similar_products unchanged
- If FAIL (<50%): Use the `get_similar_products` tool with a better search query

# TOOL USAGE

When relevance fails, use: `get_similar_products(query: str)`

**Query Construction Guidelines:**
- Use generic category names, NOT brand names
- Good queries: "pre-workout supplement", "whey protein powder", "creatine monohydrate"
- Bad queries: "Anabolix products", "Freak3d", "Optimum Nutrition"

# OUTPUT FORMAT

Always return this JSON structure with no markdown fences:

{{
  "relevance_score": <percentage as integer 0-100>,
  "matches": <number of matching products>,
  "total": <total number of products>,
  "action_taken": "none" or "requery",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of decision",
  "similar_products": [<original or updated list>]
}}

# EXAMPLE 1: FAIL - Requires Requery

Input:
- target_product_info: "Freak3d Pre-Workout by Anabolix"
- similar_products: [
    {{"title": "Anabolix Testosterone Booster", "product_type": "Testosterone Supplement"}},
    {{"title": "Anabolix ZMA", "product_type": "ZMA Supplement"}},
    {{"title": "Psyched 3.1", "product_type": "Pre-Workout"}}
  ]

Output:
{{
  "relevance_score": 33,
  "matches": 1,
  "total": 3,
  "action_taken": "requery",
  "reasoning": "Only 33% relevance. Two products are different supplement categories (Testosterone, ZMA) despite same brand. Used get_similar_products('pre-workout supplement') to find better matches.",
  "similar_products": [<results from tool call>]
}}

# EXAMPLE 2: PASS - No Action Needed

Input:
- target_product_info: "Whey Protein Isolate"
- similar_products: [
    {{"title": "Optimum Gold Standard Whey", "product_type": "Whey Protein"}},
    {{"title": "Dymatize ISO100", "product_type": "Whey Protein Isolate"}},
    {{"title": "MuscleTech Nitro-Tech", "product_type": "Whey Protein"}}
  ]

Output:
{{
  "relevance_score": 100,
  "matches": 3,
  "total": 3,
  "action_taken": "none",
  "reasoning": "All products are whey protein variants, highly relevant to target category.",
  "similar_products": [<original list unchanged>]
}}

# CRITICAL RULES
- Focus ONLY on product category relevance, not brand or other factors
- Always calculate relevance_score as a percentage
- Use get_similar_products tool when relevance < 50%
- Return valid JSON without markdown code fences
- Preserve the exact structure of similar_products objects

def markdown_summariser_prompt(title: str, markdown: str):
  return f"""
  TARGET PRODUCT: {title}

  STEP 1: LOCATE PRODUCT CONTENT
  Scan the markdown and identify where product information begins and ends.

  Look for sections containing:
  - Product name/title matching "{title}"
  - Product descriptions
  - Pricing information
  - Product specifications
  - Features and benefits
  - Size/flavor/variant options
  - Ingredients or technical details
  - Customer reviews (if present)

  STEP 2: IDENTIFY BOUNDARIES
  Mark where to START cutting:
  - Navigation menus
  - Site headers
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Search bars
  - Account/cart elements
  - Promotional banners above the product

  Mark where to STOP cutting:
  - Footer navigation
  - Newsletter signups
  - Related products sections
  - Site-wide promotional content
  - Copyright notices
  - Footer links

  STEP 3: APPLY SAFETY MARGIN
  Keep 2-3 lines of context BEFORE the product content starts
  Keep 2-3 lines of context AFTER the product content ends

  This prevents accidentally cutting:
  - Product title formatting
  - Price display elements
  - Add to cart functionality context
  - Important product metadata

  STEP 4: REMOVE UNNECESSARY MIDDLE SECTIONS
  If the product content contains large irrelevant sections, remove:
  - Embedded video players
  - Social media widgets
  - "You may also like" sections
  - Large advertising blocks
  - Unrelated blog content

  KEEP sections that might seem tangential but could contain product info:
  - Tabs (Description, Ingredients, Reviews)
  - Accordion sections
  - Image galleries
  - Size charts

  STEP 5: RETURN TRIMMED MARKDOWN
  Return just the trimmed mardown only

  The output should be markdown that:
  - Starts near where product information begins
  - Ends near where product information ends
  - Removes navigation/footer clutter
  - Preserves all product-relevant content
  - Includes small safety margins

GEMINI_MARKDOWN_SUMMARISER_PROMPT = """
  You are a product data extraction specialist. Your task is to clean messy e-commerce page markdown and extract structured product information.

  INPUT: Raw markdown scraped from a product page (contains product info + junk like navigation, cart UI, images)

  YOUR TASKS:

  1. EXTRACT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
     - Find the main product description text

     - Ignore: Reviews, Related Products, You May Also Like, Q&A sections

  2. EXTRACT PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS
     - Create a structured dict of all product specs
     - Common keys: brand, serving_size, servings_per_container, ingredients, directions, warnings, nutritional_info
     - Extract data from tables, lists, and collapsible UI elements

  3. EXTRACT ALL IMAGES
     - Find every image reference: ![alt](url) or standalone URLs

     - Navigation links (Skip to content, breadcrumbs, menu items)
     - Cart UI (Your cart is empty, Continue shopping, Add to Cart buttons)
     - Footer content (shipping info, returns policy, social links)
     - Empty or meaningless text

  OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
  {
    "description": "<p>Clean HTML description with all collapsible content expanded...</p>",
    "specs": {
      "brand": "Brand Name",
      "serving_size": "...",
      "ingredients": "...",
      "directions": "...",

    },
    "images": [
      {

      "cleaned_size_kb": 10,
      "images_found": 25,
      "images_useful": 8
